      <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the sugar over medium heat, stirring continually until it melts and turns golden-brown<li> Quickly pour the caramel into the bottom of an 8–9 inch flan pan or loaf pan, tilting it to coat evenly. Be careful, as the pan will be hot.<li>Allow the caramel to harden slightly while preparing the custard</li>
		  <li>In a bowl or blender, combine eggs, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Blend or whisk until smooth</li>
		  <li>Pour the custard mixture over the hardened caramel in the pan</li>
		  <li>Cover the pan with aluminum foil or a tight-fitting lid</li>
		  <li>Place the flan pan in a larger baking dish (to act as a water bath).</li>
		  <li>Pour hot water into the larger dish to come about halfway up the sides of the flan pan.</li>
		  <li>Bake at 350&deg;F (175&deg;C) for 50–90 minutes, depending on pan size. The flan is done when the edges are set, but the center slightly jiggles.</li>
		  <li>Remove the flan from the water bath carefully and allow it to cool to room temperature.</li>
		  <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to fully set the custard</li>
		  <li>Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the flan
		<li>cover with a serving plate and invert the pan carefully so that the flan releases onto the plate with the caramel on top </li> 
		<li> after Serve slices as is or garnish with fresh fruit for presentation </li>
